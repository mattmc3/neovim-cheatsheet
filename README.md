# Neovim Cheat Sheet

A modern and customizable take on the excellent [viemu cheat
sheet][viemu-cheat-sheet], supporting vanilla QWERTY as well as alternative
keyboard layouts such as Colemak and Dvorak.

## Project genesis

When I was first learning [neovim][neovim], having a cheatsheet was incredibly
helpful. There are many excellent ones online, but most of them were distributed
as image files. That was fine if you use a QWERTY keyboard and don't want to
customize your vimrc. But I use an alternative keyboard, [Colemak][colemak]. And
I prefer to `nnoremap` some of my normal mode keys. I wanted an easy to
manipulate the cheat sheet where I could first rearrange the keys to match my
keyboard layout, and then test out other arrangements of keys to match my
desired `nnoremap`s. I figured [Google Sheets][google-sheets] would be a simple
way to experiment, and thus this project was born.

## Code

There's a pretty rudimentary [apps-script][apps-script] for generating the basic
template included in this repo, but that's not required. It's something I used
to bootstrap these Google Sheets.

## Contributing

This project is designed in such a way that you are free to copy these Google
Docs to your personal Google Drive and manipulate them however you wish ([see
Creative Commons Attribution license here][license]). If you find a spelling,
grammar, formatting, or accuracy issue, please submit a [GitHub Issue][issues]
and I will happily correct those kinds of errors in the master documents.

If there's a layout you wish were included, you are welcome to submit a GitHub
Issue, however I cannot support every layout. Depending on the layout's
viability and usefulness to a broad audience, I will likely recommend that you
maintain your own document.

Please do not submit your personal neovim nnoremaps. I included a few Colemak
samples just to whet your appetite to show how you can make your own, but they
are not a contributable part of this project.

Note that fidelity in exporting to Excel is not in scope for this project.
Please do not submit issues related to Excel.
